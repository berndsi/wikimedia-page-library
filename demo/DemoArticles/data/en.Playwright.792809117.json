In this famous text, Aristotle established the principle of action or <i>praxis</i> as the basis for all drama. He then included a hierarchy of elements for the drama beginning with <a href=\"/wiki/Plot_(narrative)\" title=\"Plot (narrative)\">plot</a> (<i>\u03bc\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 mythos</i>), character (<i>\u03ad\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 <a href=\"/wiki/Ethos\" title=\"Ethos\">ethos</a></i>), thought (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Dianoia\" title=\"Dianoia\">dianoia</a></i>), diction (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Lexis_(Aristotle)\" title=\"Lexis (Aristotle)\">lexis</a></i>), music (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Melody\" title=\"Melody\">melodia</a></i>), and spectacle (<i>opsis</i>). The ends of drama were plot, character, and thought, the means of drama were language and music, and the manner of presentation a spectacle. Since the <a href=\"/wiki/Mythology\" title=\"Mythology\">myths</a>, upon which <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_tragedy\" title=\"Greek tragedy\">Greek tragedy</a> were based, were widely known, plot had to do with the arrangement and selection of existing material. Character was equated with choice as rather than psychology, so that character was determined by action. In <a href=\"/wiki/Tragedy\" title=\"Tragedy\">tragedy</a>, the notion of ethical choice determined the character of the individual. Thought had more to do and \"the imitation of an action that is serious\", and so forth, brought with it the concept of <a href=\"/wiki/Mimesis\" title=\"Mimesis\">mimesis</a> (from real life). Thus, he developed his notion of <a href=\"/wiki/Hamartia\" title=\"Hamartia\">hamartia</a>, or tragic flaw, an error in judgment by the main character or <a href=\"/wiki/Protagonist\" title=\"Protagonist\">protagonist</a>.

This meant that the playwright had to construct the play so that its \"virtual\" time would not exceed 24 hours, that it would be restricted to a single setting, and that there would be no subplots. Other terms, such as verisimilitude and decorum, circumscribed the subject matter significantly. For example, verisimilitude limits of the unities. Decorum fitted proper protocols for behavior and language on stage. In France, contained too many events and actions, thus, violating the 24-hour restriction of the unity of time.
