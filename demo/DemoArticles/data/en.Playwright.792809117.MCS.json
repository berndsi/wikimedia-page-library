Hence the prefix and the suffix combine to indicate someone who has \"wrought\" words, themes, and other elements into a dramatic form - someone who crafts plays. The <a href=\"/wiki/Homophone\" title=\"Homophone\">homophone</a> with \"write\" is in this case entirely coincidental.</p>\n\n<p>The term \"playwright\" appears to have been coined by <a href=\"/wiki/Ben_Jonson\" title=\"Ben Jonson\">Ben Jonson</a> in his Epigram 49, \"To Playwright\",<span class=\"mw-ref\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\" style=\"counter-reset: mw-Ref 1;\"><span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[1]</span></a></span> as an insult, to suggest a mere tradesman fashioning works for the theatre. Jonson described himself as a poet, not a playwright, since plays during that time were written in meter and so were regarded as the province of poets. This view was held as late as the early 19th century. The term \"playwright\" later lost this negative connotation.</p>\n\n",

        "text": "\n<p>In the 4th century BCE, <a href=\"/wiki/Aristotle\" title=\"Aristotle\">Aristotle</a> wrote his <i><a href=\"/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)\" title=\"Poetics (Aristotle)\">Poetics</a></i>, the first play-writing manual. In this famous text, Aristotle established the principle of action or <i>praxis</i> as the basis for all drama. He then included a hierarchy of elements for the drama beginning with <a href=\"/wiki/Plot_(narrative)\" title=\"Plot (narrative)\">plot</a> (<i>μύθος mythos</i>), character (<i>έθος <a href=\"/wiki/Ethos\" title=\"Ethos\">ethos</a></i>), thought (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Dianoia\" title=\"Dianoia\">dianoia</a></i>), diction (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Lexis_(Aristotle)\" title=\"Lexis (Aristotle)\">lexis</a></i>), music (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Melody\" title=\"Melody\">melodia</a></i>), and spectacle (<i>opsis</i>). The ends of drama were plot, character, and thought, the means of drama were language and music, and the manner of presentation a spectacle. Since the <a href=\"/wiki/Mythology\" title=\"Mythology\">myths</a>, upon which <a href=\"/wiki/Greek_tragedy\" title=\"Greek tragedy\">Greek tragedy</a> were based, were widely known, plot had to do with the arrangement and selection of existing material. Character was equated with choice as rather than psychology, so that character was determined by action. In <a href=\"/wiki/Tragedy\" title=\"Tragedy\">tragedy</a>, the notion of ethical choice determined the character of the individual. Thought had more to do and  \"the imitation of an action that is serious\", and so forth, brought with it the concept of <a href=\"/wiki/Mimesis\" title=\"Mimesis\">mimesis</a> (from real life). Thus, he developed his notion of <a href=\"/wiki/Hamartia\" title=\"Hamartia\">hamartia</a>, or tragic flaw, an error in judgment by the main character or <a href=\"/wiki/Protagonist\" title=\"Protagonist\">protagonist</a>.  It provides the basis for the \"conflict-driven\" play, a term still held as the <i>sine qua non</i> of dramaturgy. The <i><a href=\"/wiki/Poetics_(Aristotle)\" title=\"Poetics (Aristotle)\">Poetics</a></i>, while very brief and highly condensed, is still studied today.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most Aristotelian of contemporary playwrights is <a href=\"/wiki/David_Mamet\" title=\"David Mamet\">David Mamet</a>, who embraces the idea of character as \"agent of the action\", and emphasizes causality in the structure of his plays. His recently revived <i><a href=\"/wiki/Speed-the-Plow\" title=\"Speed-the-Plow\">Speed-the-Plow</a></i> is quintessentially Aristotelian, in that it both observes the unities (with exception of Act I's change in place) and builds its plot through a causal stream of discoveries and reversals.</p>\n\n",

The <a href=\"/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture\" title=\"Neoclassical architecture\">neoclassical</a> ideal, which was to reach its apogee in France during the 17th century, dwelled upon the <a href=\"/wiki/Unities\" title=\"Unities\" class=\"mw-redirect\">unities</a>, of action, place, and time. This meant that the playwright had to construct the play so that its \"virtual\" time would not exceed 24 hours, that it would be restricted to a single setting, and that there would be no subplots. Other terms, such as verisimilitude and decorum, circumscribed the subject matter significantly. For example, verisimilitude limits of the unities. Decorum fitted proper protocols for behavior and language on stage. \nIn France,  contained too many events and actions, thus, violating the 24-hour restriction of the unity of time. Neoclassicism never had as much traction in England, and <a href=\"/wiki/Shakespeare\" title=\"Shakespeare\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Shakespeare</a>'s plays are directly opposed to these models, while in Italy, improvised and bawdy <a href=\"/wiki/Commedia_dell'arte\" title=\"Commedia dell'arte\">commedia dell'arte</a> and opera were more popular forms.

In most cases, the character receiving the secret information misinterprets its contents, thus setting off a chain of events.

Ironically, the character Nora's leaving is as much motivated by \"the letter\" and disclosure of a \"past secret\" as it is by her own determination to strike out on her own.

Many regional theatres have hired dramaturges and literary managers in an effort to showcase various festivals for new work, or bring in playwrights for residencies. Funding through national organizations, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts\" title=\"National Endowment for the Arts\">National Endowment for the Arts</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/Theatre_Communications_Group\" title=\"Theatre Communications Group\">Theatre Communications Group</a>, encouraged the partnerships of professional theatre companies and emerging playwrights.and fast rule about this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/wiki/New_Dramatists\" title=\"New Dramatists\">New Dramatists</a> and <a rel=\"mw:ExtLink\" href=\"http://www.larktheatre.org\" class=\"external\">The Lark</a> in New York, for example, will often have a \"cold\" reading of a script in an informal sitdown setting. A cold reading means that the actors haven't rehearsed the work, or may be seeing it for the first time, and usually, the technical requirements are minimal. Shenandoah and the O'Neill Festival offer summer retreats for playwrights to develop their work with directors and actors in a totally \"devoted\" setting.</p>\n\n<p>There has been a backlash over the past ten years with the formation of Playwriting Collectives like 13P and <a href=\"/wiki/Clubbed_Thumb\" title=\"Clubbed Thumb\">Clubbed Thumb</a> who have gathered members together to produce, rather than develop, new works. This has been a reaction to the \"developed to death\" notion in which the play never gets produced, but goes through endless readings and critiques that after a certain point in New York go through some kind of assiduous development process, and rare is the play that shows up on a producer's desk that gains any traction.
